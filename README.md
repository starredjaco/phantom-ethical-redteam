# Phantom - Ethical RedTeam

> **ARCHIVED — 2026-04-03**
> This project has been discontinued. It successfully demonstrated that AI can automate complex offensive security tasks autonomously. The approach has since been superseded by AI agents with dedicated skills, which achieve better results with less custom infrastructure. The code is preserved here as a proof-of-concept.

> An autonomous AI red team agent that thinks, adapts, and hacks like a real attacker.

![Phantom in action](images/phantom-banner.png)

Phantom is an open-source autonomous offensive security agent. Point it at an authorized target, and it reasons through the entire attack chain on its own — no predefined phases, no hand-holding, no fixed script. It forms its own attack hypotheses, pursues multiple vectors simultaneously, writes custom tools when it needs them, and delivers a full debrief when it's done.

**This project exists to prove one thing:** AI can do offensive security autonomously.

> **Legal notice:** Use only on systems you own or have written authorization to test. Nothing in this repository grants permission to target third-party systems.

## Why Phantom?

Most security tools run a checklist. Phantom doesn't. It:

- **Reasons like an attacker** — forms concurrent hypotheses, pursues the highest-impact ones first, abandons dead ends and spawns new vectors
- **Chains findings** — combines vulnerabilities into real exploitation paths (SSRF + internal metadata = cloud credentials = RCE)
- **Writes its own tools** — when built-in tools aren't enough, it generates and executes custom Python scripts on the fly
- **Never stops on its own** — missions run until all attack vectors are exhausted, not until a timer goes off
- **Debriefs with precision** — timeline, attack graph, full chain reconstruction, nothing left out

## Supported LLM Providers

Phantom works with any of these out of the box. Local models via Ollama are fully supported — no cloud required.

| Provider | Default Model | API Key Env Var |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic (Claude) | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI (ChatGPT) | `gpt-5.4` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| xAI (Grok) | `grok-4-20-beta` | `XAI_API_KEY` |
| Google (Gemini) | `gemini-3.0-pro` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| Mistral | `mistral-large-latest` | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` |
| DeepSeek | `deepseek-chat-v3.2` | `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` |
| Ollama (local) | `deepseek-v3.2:cloud` | *(none)* |

## What's in the Toolbox

### Reconnaissance
- **Subdomain discovery** — passive enumeration via crt.sh + HackerTarget
- **Port scanning** — Nmap with quick, service, full, and vuln scan modes
- **Tech fingerprinting** — WhatWeb with Python fallback
- **Auto recon** — single call that runs nmap + whatweb + sensitive file probing and generates attack hypotheses from results

### Scanning & Fuzzing
- **CVE scanning** — Nuclei for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
- **WordPress scanner** — version, users, plugins, xmlrpc, debug.log, config backups
- **Directory fuzzing** — ffuf for hidden endpoints
- **SQL injection** — sqlmap detection and exploitation
- **Payload library** — PayloadsAllTheThings integration (13 attack categories)
- **Dynamic tool forge** — LLM writes and executes targeted Python scripts for anything not covered

### Exploitation & Network
- **Auto exploit** — takes a confirmed finding and immediately generates + runs a targeted exploit script
- **Credential brute force** — Hydra for HTTP, SSH, FTP, MySQL, RDP
- **Metasploit** — module search, exploit execution, auxiliary scanning
- **JWT attacks** — HS256 brute force, alg=none, claim tampering, token forging
- **GraphQL enumeration** — introspection, schema dump, sensitive field discovery
- **Privilege escalation** — Linux/Windows enumeration (SUID, sudo, Docker, SeImpersonate)
- **Network MITM** — ARP probing via Bettercap (Linux only)

### Evidence & Stealth
- **Screenshots** — Playwright / wkhtmltoimage / Chromium capture
- **Auth management** — bearer, basic, cookie, custom headers per target
- **Stealth profiles** — 4 modes (silent / stealthy / normal / aggressive) with UA rotation and proxy support

### Reporting
- **Report generation** — Markdown + HTML + optional PDF
- **Mission diff** — compare sessions to track remediation (new / resolved / persistent)
- **Risk scoring** — aggregate CVSS from findings
- **Scope check** — hard boundary enforced before every network action
- **Log reader** — parse Nuclei JSONL, ffuf JSON, and other tool outputs

## How It Works

Phantom v3 runs a **Plan-Act-Observe-Reflect** loop driven by a **hypothesis priority queue** — not a turn counter.

```
Mission start
  │
  ├─ Seed: 6 concurrent initial hypotheses per target
  │    "SQLi/SSTI/SSRF on all input surfaces"
  │    "Exposed .env/.git/swagger/admin endpoints"
  │    "Default credentials on auth surfaces"
  │    "Open ports → targeted service attacks"
  │    ...
  │
  └─ Loop (runs until all hypotheses exhausted):
       PLAN  — LLM picks highest-priority hypotheses, creates multi-vector plan
       ACT   — Runs up to 4 tools in parallel
       OBSERVE — Extracts findings, feeds new hypotheses back into queue
       REFLECT — If stalled: pivot. If critical found: escalate immediately.
       STRATEGIST (every 5 turns) — Injects high-level attack chain analysis
```

Every confirmed finding automatically generates follow-up hypotheses:
- Injection finding → blind SQLi + time-based + SSTI
- Exposed config file → credential read + backup file search
- Auth weakness → privilege escalation + password reuse
- Open DB port → default credentials + external access test
- Admin panel → default creds + auth bypass + privesc

The mission ends when the queue is exhausted — not when a timer runs out.

## Changelog

### v3.2.0
- **Parallel execution enforced** — LLM is required to call a minimum of 3 tools per response; if it returns only 1, the orchestrator auto-nudges with the top pending hypotheses and forces a parallel batch
- **Turn-based UX eliminated** — "Turn X" messages moved to debug log; operator sees tool execution (`[*] Executing 4 tools in parallel: ...`) and findings (`[!] [CRITICAL] ...`) only
- **Burst launch mode** — mission start seeds 12 tiered hypotheses per target (injection, exposure, auth, CVE, admin, fuzzing, recon) via `HypothesisEngine.burst_launch()`
- **`fetch_exploit` tool** — searches ExploitDB (searchsploit) and GitHub PoC repos for CVEs and known vulnerabilities; downloads and executes exploit scripts against authorized targets via sandbox
- **Bug fixes** — fixed dead-code `_check_mission_complete` hypothesis path; fixed stale finding injection on text-only turns; updated 7 stale tests to match current output format
- **253 unit tests** (up from 246)

### v3.1.0
- **Hypothesis-driven engine** — missions are driven by a priority queue of attack hypotheses, not a turn counter. The mission ends when all attack vectors are exhausted.
- **Auto follow-up generation** — every confirmed finding automatically spawns targeted follow-up hypotheses (injection → blind SQLi + SSTI; auth weakness → privesc; exposed port → targeted service attack)
- **Fixed reflection pipeline** — the reflect phase was a stub that did nothing; now parses `<reflection>` blocks and drives actual pivot decisions
- **Strategist feedback loop** — strategic analysis results are now injected back into the LLM conversation as guidance messages
- **Real tool output parsing** — finding extraction now handles actual nmap/nuclei/whatweb/ffuf output formats (not just `[CRITICAL]` tags that tools never emit)
- **Aggressive system prompt** — rewritten from 53 lines of passive instructions to 137 lines of attacker-mindset reasoning, covering SSTI, SSRF, prototype pollution, JWT forgery, deserialization, 0-day fuzzing, and chain-thinking examples
- **Multi-vector mission seeding** — initial message now seeds 6 concurrent hypotheses per target across all attack surface categories
- **Max turns raised** — default 80 → 100 (mission usually ends earlier via hypothesis exhaustion)

### v3.0.x
- v3 PAOR orchestrator replacing v2 linear loop
- Dynamic Tool Forge (LLM generates and executes custom Python scripts)
- MissionMemory with SQLite persistence
- AttackGraph with Mermaid visualization
- ReflectionLayer with stall detection and pivot decisions
- XML plan block parsing for structured LLM output
- 246 unit tests
